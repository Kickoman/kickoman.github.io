# !שלום עליכם

## Who am I?

Well, the only you should now is that I'm Kickoman (not kickoman**us**, but that's not too important).
Anyway, your presence here probably means you know me, so don't fuck around. However, this account (kickoman) is personal and for
side-projects only.

## List of stuff (incomplete)

1. **TrainChat** - [chat.eliteme.me](http://chat.eliteme.me/) - shitty PHP-based chat I've written once when I was in train just for fun.
2. ur anus
