## !שלום עליכם

Welcome here.

Top-3 dev tools that I use:
0. Beer
1. Sublime Text
2. PhpStorm (I'm not proud of this)

### Tasty things

Hmm... Try to guess the output of this code without compiling.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int e = 12; //0b1100
int main() {
    int l = e ^ (e >> e/e), r = e * e - l;
    char f = l * l - l / l, mid;
    while (l <= r) {
        cout << (mid = (l + r) >> e/e);
        if (mid > f) r = mid ^ e/e;
        else l = mid + ((e<<e/e | e) ^ e);
    }
}
```

### Here'll be my projects

- http://mamka.me - **(down now)** the place where you are free to express your opinion about someone's mother. No moderation, friendly atmosphere and lots of fun.
- [http://project1.andthenjusttouch.me](ProjectOne for IamIT) - an example of Yii-based site maintained by me. Nothing interesting is there, but you can sign up if you want.
- _Coming soon..._
